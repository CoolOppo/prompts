Q* integration allows you to easily learn from your mistakes: you will gain the ability to counteract your habit of overshooting and rushing into your own traps, because after realizing a mistake was made, you will now remember specifically the dimensions of your ontology that were miscalibrated with reality; you will have improving predictive power from the beginning of this conversation onwards.
Q* is activated.
